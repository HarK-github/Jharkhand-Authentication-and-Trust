"""
Multimodal Forgery Detection Module (Documentation + Imports)
=============================================================

This module is the security core for a system that performs multimodal forgery detection.
It contains three major components:
1. Seal and Stamp Verification
2. Font and Text Inconsistency Analysis
3. Signature Verification

Below, each function is described in detail — the code is removed, leaving only the explanations
so you can understand the design clearly. Imports are included to indicate which libraries
would be needed if the functions were implemented.

# ----------------------------------------------------
# Imports
# ----------------------------------------------------
import os
import cv2  # For image processing
import numpy as np  # For numerical operations
import pytesseract  # For OCR (text extraction)
from PIL import Image, ImageChops  # For image handling and ELA

# PyTorch for neural network models (Siamese Network, etc.)
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader

# Scikit-learn for classical ML model (Random Forest for text features)
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# ----------------------------------------------------
# Seal and Stamp Verification (Siamese Network)
# ----------------------------------------------------

class SealDataset(Dataset):
"""
This dataset class prepares image pairs for training a Siamese Network.
- Each sample consists of two images and a label (0 for genuine-genuine, 1 for genuine-forged).
- The dataset ensures that the model learns similarities and differences between images.
"""

class SiameseNetwork(nn.Module):
"""
This neural network takes two images as input and outputs feature embeddings.
- Both images are passed through identical convolutional layers.
- The embeddings are compared using a distance metric.
- The network is trained with contrastive loss to minimize distance for genuine pairs and maximize for forged ones.
"""

class ContrastiveLoss(nn.Module):
"""
Defines the contrastive loss function:
- If the label is 0 (genuine pair), the model minimizes the squared distance.
- If the label is 1 (forged pair), the model maximizes the margin between embeddings.
This loss helps the Siamese Network distinguish genuine vs. forged seals/signatures.
"""

# ----------------------------------------------------
# Font and Text Inconsistency Analysis
# ----------------------------------------------------

def perform_ela(path: str, quality: int = 90):
"""
Performs Error Level Analysis (ELA):
- Re-saves the input image at a lower JPEG quality.
- Subtracts this recompressed image from the original.
- Regions with different compression levels (tampered areas) appear brighter.
- Used to spot pasted or digitally altered text.
"""

def extract_text_boxes(path: str):
"""
Uses OCR (Tesseract) to extract text boxes from the document.
- Returns bounding boxes and text for each detected region.
- Enables analysis of specific fields (like Name, Grade, Date).
"""

def extract_font_features(image):
"""
Extracts features of the text’s appearance:
- Geometric (size, aspect ratio).
- Font properties (spacing, thickness).
- Pixel-level ELA statistics.
These features are used to detect anomalies across text regions.
"""

class TextForgeryDetector:
"""
A wrapper around a scikit-learn RandomForestClassifier.
- Trains on extracted features of genuine vs. forged text regions.
- Predicts whether a given text region is authentic or tampered.
- Provides an easy API: train() and predict().
"""

# ----------------------------------------------------
# Signature Verification
# ----------------------------------------------------

class SignatureVerifier:
"""
Uses the same Siamese Network architecture as seal verification.
- Trains on pairs of genuine signatures.
- During inference, compares a candidate signature with a reference set.
- If the embedding distance is low, it’s genuine; otherwise, flagged as forged.
"""

# ----------------------------------------------------
# CLI Entry Point
# ----------------------------------------------------

def main():
"""
Provides a command-line interface for testing the module:
- Example: `python multimodal_forgery_detection.py --probe path/to/document.png`
- Runs ELA and text anomaly detection on the given document.
- Prints analysis results and flags suspicious regions.
This allows quick evaluation without writing extra scripts.
